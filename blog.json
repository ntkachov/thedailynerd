    "body": "<p>A few short interesting things to note: </p>\n<p>\nThe wear API communicates over bluetooth, so sending large images can take quite a bit of time. Sending 100KB at a time, the wear API needs to break up any large files into smaller chunks. Meaning sending a 200kb file is the same as sending 2 100kb files. This overhead results in some slow transfers of larger files. Crunching files down to their most necessary sizes is essential. Bitmaps should be compressed down to their target sizes when transferring.</p>\n<p>\nCommunicating between the watch and the phone using data Items is fast, but not instant. Its worth while to kick off any data request to the watch well before you need that data. </p>\n\n<p>The status bar of the watch api doesn't change unless you call super.onVisibilityChanged(). So if switching watch faces keeps the system clock, you forgot to call super.onVisibilityChanged(). </p>\n\n<p> Changing the bounds inside onDraw affects the redraw of the screen. You can prevent certain parts of the screen from being redrawn by changing the bounds inside onDraw. </p> \n\n<p> More to come </p>",

    "body": "<p> The platforms have gotten so advanced that some of the apps for Android are starting to push into desktop territory. Heck, full IDEs exist on Android that let you make Android apps within Android.  </p>\n<p> This functionality has to be documented somewhere right? Well, no. Unless the dev has gone out of their way to put in what amounts to an extra app inside their app, help features for apps are usually a popup dialog with some shoddy written help text detailing the basics of the app.</p>\n<p>I think help menus are just as important for mobile apps as they are for desktop apps. Especially since mobile apps are starting to become more and more fleshed out with serious features which need documentation. Even Googles flagship Drive app has shoddy help. Lets walk through the experience of getting help with Drive.</p>\n<p> I start off where I left off, reading some document. Where is the help button? No where to be found. Its flat out not on this page. I have to back out into the documents list.  Now where is it? I have to click on the overflow menu on the top right hand corner and only then do I get a button \"Help\". When I click it, it opens up the browser and loads support.google. Not only does it not know I'm on an android device, the entire website is slow and clunky. </p> \n<p> The actual help page for the Google drive is actually really good, but getting what I need takes far too long. All I wanted was to figure out how to edit a comment.</p>",
