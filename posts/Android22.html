"title": "Android 22 Notable API Changes",
"blurb": "New notable API changes include, Referrers in Activities, A few screen new Wear notification settings
new screen, URI schemes, and a bunch of Web View apis became Abstract",
"body": "<p> Referrers were added to  activities as well as intents, but they aren't trustworthy since they are easily spoofed.
<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html#getReferrer()"> Activity.getReferer() </a> </p>
<p> <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/KeyguardManager.html#isDeviceLocked()">
isDeviceLocked() was dded to the KeyguardManager</a>, making it possible to check if there is a password 
required to unlock the screen. </p> 
<p> <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Notification.Action.WearableExtender.html">
Screen timeouts and cancel/progress labels for wearable notifications were added.</a> Supposedly wear will support
progress and cancel progress notifications. Useful for uploads/downloads. </p>  
<p> <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent.html#URI_ANDROID_APP_SCHEME">
URI_ANDROID_APP_SCHEME was added to send intents directly into an application using a URI scheme. </a></p>
<p> <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#revisionCode"> Revision code was added for support 
of versioning split APKs. </a> So now your multi-apk apps can be versioned independently of each other. 
<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/pm/PackageInfo.html#baseRevisionCode"> You can 
also grab the revision code in the PackageInfo class</a>. Note: Revision code and Version code are similar and revision code
should only be used when the version codes are the same. </p>
<p> <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/res/Resources.html#getDrawable(int)">
  <b>Resources.getDrawable was depreciated!!!  </b></a> Chet wants you to use GetDrawable(int, Theme) now and pass null
  as the theme if you don't need a theme applied. My guess is that this is because of the new tinting features. 
  </p>
  <p> <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/api_diff/22/changes/android.media.tv.TvContract.Programs.Genres.html">
  We got a few new Genres hardcoded into android. Tech_Science being my favorite. </a></p>
  <p> <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/Window.html"> Window got setClipToOutline and setElevation
  methods </a> clipToOutline clips the back of the window to the background and the elevation is a very slow way 
  to set the elevation of the window. My guess is that this is for dialogs or activity transitions. 
  Also don't animate the setElevation of the window as this is really slow. </p>
  <p> <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/util/DisplayMetrics.html#DENSITY_280"> 
  We got Density_280 added. Which is an odd number. Maybe something related to a new phone with 280 dpi? </a> </p>
  
 <p> Less notable changes: </p> 
<p> Animations were refactored. A few web APIs became abstract. And Apache.http was depreciated. </p>",
