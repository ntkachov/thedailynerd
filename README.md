## Offical Repo of TheDailyNerd 

The entire site is hosted here. I moved it for a couple of reasons. 

* Save money on hosting costs (~$17/mo)
* Protect blog content from loss
* More easily update blog content.

Right now the blog works by downloading a JSON file directly from github and format the content into a nice list on the client side. This may eventually change to be more inline and static and allow for better indexing from google crawlers (right now, google crawlers don't read the blog since its loaded through ajax).
